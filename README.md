Chrome extension that helps you manage spending habits by demystifying prices.

This Chrome extension takes a price on a webpage such as Amazon and converts the price into an amount of time based on salary.
To perform this, the extension takes in the user's salary per hour and uses that value to compute how much time an item is worth.

For example, if a user works for $15 per hour and chooses to buy a 12-pack of Soylent for $32 dollars, then the price would be represented as 2.13 hours. The purpose behind this extension is to help limit spending and to encourage consumer responsiblity.

The extension's interface uses a small icon next to the price to display the time-cost. This method is non-invasive and allows users to look at the cost quickly while still seeing the original cost.
